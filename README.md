BakeHouse Delivery Application is the system used by delivery staffs at BakeHouse. The delivery staffs would be notified with the latest order if they are online with ready to delivery mode.
The staffs can then access the location of the order through google maps and update the status accordingly. the updated status would be displayed in the client application in realtime using Firebase Realtime Database.
The name and number of the delivery staff is recorded and provided to the client application.
